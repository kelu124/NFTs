#### Curated

* [SuperRare](https://superrare.co/) — Highly-curated 1-of-1 edition NFTs. The “gold standard” in the current NFT space. 

* [NiftyGateway](https://niftygateway.com/) — Fast-growing NFT market leading the pack in sales volume. Highly-sought after daily NFT drops, with popular visual artists and now celebrities getting involved. One of the few NFT platforms that accepts USD / credit card as payment.

* [Zora](https://zora.co/) — Feed-style NFT platform in which the market of each piece is baked into the NFT itself and not run by the platform. Zora therefore doesn’t take a transaction fee on each sale like the other platforms. Creating NFTs is currently invite-only. The Zora protocol is also open for anyone to build on. 

* [Foundation](https://foundation.app/) — Beautifully designed and curated NFT marketplace with reserved bidding that, once met, unlocks 24-hour auctions. Creating NFTs is currently invite-only. 

* [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) — The most open and permissionless NFT marketplace. Anyone can create an NFT right away without needing an invite, and a roadmap is in place to make the platform community-run.

* [Makersplace](https://makersplace.com/) — An invite-only creator NFT platform that accepts both Ethereum and fiat currency. Recently partnered with Christie’s auction house to sell the first fully digital piece at Christie’s, by artist Beeple. 

* [KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/) — Quality NFT art platform with multiple weekly drops. Offers accepted in ETH.
